# 🔐 TaskVault — Secure MERN Todo Application

TaskVault is a **full-stack MERN Todo application** built with a strong focus on **authentication, security, and real-world backend practices**.  
It supports **user signup/login**, **JWT-based authentication**, **password hashing with bcrypt**, and **secure task management** where each user can manage only their own tasks.

This project was built as a **learning + portfolio project** to understand how real production-style apps handle:
- Authentication & Authorization
